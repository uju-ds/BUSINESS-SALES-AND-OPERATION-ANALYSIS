# BUSINESS-SALES-AND-OPERATION-ANALYSIS
The key insights and recommended metrics from the business dataset
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
### User Activation:
• 54.7% of registered users made ≥1 purchase
• Suggestion: The management could implement first time order incentive or discount to encourage registered users to make purchase
### Device Preference:
• preferred device is IOS, while 38.4 %preferred android and just 16.9% preferred device was web
### Revenue Drivers:
• Order from dinner purchase generated54.1% of the total income, while lunch purchase was 42.4%
### Market Audience (Target):
• Top 3 countries with highest active users are
• Finland(FIN)
• Denmark(DNM)
• Greece(GRC)

### ACTIVE USERS ANALYSIS
• INSIGHT
The data shows that out of 21,983 registered users, only 54.7% of them made at least one purchase after registration. This means that the other 45.3% are untapped customers. This would have a
negative impact on the revenue being generated. This high percentage on untapped registered customers, indicates that the registration or onboarding process need to be reviewed and
high customer churn
• Recommendation:
-The management could produce a more enticing marketing strategy such as first 24-hours sales discount

-Implement the use of web recommender system to boost activation rates

-The website for onboarding could send an email to some inactive users, with an enticing incentive offer

### MEAL ORDER DEMAND ANALYSIS
• INSIGHT
The data shows that there was higher order or demand for Dinner(54.1%) followed by lunch(42.4%). This also indicate higher revenue generation from dinner purchases.
• Recommendation:
-The management could ensure optimized delivery process during these times
-Introduce a marketing strategy for breakfast purchase, to improve the demand for breakfast

### GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS
• INSIGHT
The data shows that the highest purchase count and number of users were from Finland, Denmark and Greece, respectively. This indicates strong adoption of the Wolt application.
• Recommendation:
-More improved logistic process in these regions to sustain the customers.
-Regional promotion for the under-represented regions

### CUSTOMER ANALYSIS
• INSIGHT
• This table highlights the top 10 users by total spending (€), showing their purchase count and how long they’ve been active (retention days). User 21703 is the highest spender (€7,979.62) 
but only made 14 purchases over 281 days — this suggests very high-value orders. In contrast, User 80 made 320 purchases (the highest count), but spent less (€4,335.41), meaning they placed low-value, frequent
orders. This indicates that high purchase is not equate to high frequency of order
• Recommendation:
-Create a business strategy to sustain both the high purchase and high retention such as premium subscription and so on

### PAYMENT METHOD ANALYSIS
• INSIGHT
•The pie chart shows the proportion of users with valid payment methods (True) versus those without (False). 66% of users do NOT have a valid payment method (False) and only 34% have a valid payment method (True).
This means 2 out of every 3 users cannot complete a purchase due to missing payment details. This indicates that users without payment methods cannot convert into paying customers, which leads to loss of revenue generation opportunity (negative impact on growth)
• Recommendation:
-Implementation of Simplify Payment Onboarding
- Introduction of Incentivize Payment Setup
